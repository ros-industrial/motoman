  <Param value="0.01202" max="1.20199" type="RichAbsPerc" name="CellSize" description="Precision" min="0" tooltip="Size of the cell, the default is 1/50 of the box diag. Smaller cells give better precision at a higher computational cost. Remember that halving the cell size means that you build a volume 8 times larger."/>

Values greater than zero mean an external surface, and lower than zero mean an internal surface.&lt;br> In practice this value is the threshold passed to the Marching Cube algorithm to extract the isosurface from the distance field representation."/>
  <Param value="false" type="RichBool" name="mergeCloseVert" description="Clean Vertices" tooltip="If true the mesh generated by MC will be cleaned by unifying vertices that are almost coincident"/>
  <Param value="false" type="RichBool" name="discretize" description="Discretize" tooltip="If true the position of the intersected edge of the marching cube grid is not computed by linear interpolation, but it is placed in fixed middle position. As a consequence the resampled object will look severely aliased by a stairstep appearance.&lt;br>Useful only for simulating the output of 3D printing devices."/>
  <Param value="false" type="RichBool" name="multisample" description="Multisample" tooltip="If true the distance field is more accurately compute by multisampling the volume (7 sample for each voxel). Much slower but less artifacts."/>
  <Param value="false" type="RichBool" name="absDist" description="Absolute Distance" tooltip="If true a &lt;b> not&lt;/b> signed distance field is computed. In this case you have to choose a not zero Offset and a double surface is built around the original surface, inside and outside. Is useful to convrt thin floating surfaces into &lt;i> solid, thick meshes.&lt;/i>. t"/>

  <Param value="1" type="RichFloat" name="BoundaryWeight" description="Boundary Preserving Weight" tooltip="The importance of the boundary during simplification. Default (1.0) means that the boundary has the same importance of the rest. Values greater than 1.0 raise boundary importance and has the effect of removing less vertices on the border.
